    <h2>Decide the Fate of the World</h2>
    <p>The world is at war. <strong>Alliance</strong> challenges you and your opponents to decide 
        the outcome. As one of the world powers 
        battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
         military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
        You have to form alliances and then betray your 
        allies before they betray you!Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
        of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
       raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion 
       with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
       move into enemy territory with your forces and win 
       the conflict.The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. 
       Buy armaments and develop secret 
       weapons from your country's economic funds and 
       natural reserves, but be sure to save 
       something for the future.</p>

        <h2>Tedious and Confusing</h2>
        <p>The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
            share similar features including the 
            formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
            through random draws of a deck or the 
            roll of the die.<strong> Alliance</strong> offers very little that 
            is new or innovative in that regard.We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
            In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
            reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
            playing the game. If you want to read a 
            book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.</p>

        <h2>Decent Game but Many are Better</h2>
        <p><strong>Alliance </strong> a good war simulation game. We found the 
            game play to be robust and engaging. The 
            rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
            experience in this class of board games, there 
            is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
            think the battle simulation cards are some of 
            the best we have encountered. 
            All of that being said, the competition for this type 
            of game is fierce. There are a lot of 
            established titles with loyal clients. We're not 
            exactly sure where <strong>Alliance</strong> fits in with 
            that group. It's a good game, but not good enough 
            to draw our attention away from games like 
            Battle Tested and Global Conflict.</p>

        <h2> Fun and Challenging</h2>
        <p><strong>Alliance</strong> is fun game and is sure to appeal to 
            war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new 
            ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the 
            investment options give the game a "real world" feel.</p>
        <p>Things We Liked</p> 
        <li>Variety of Battle Scenarios</li>
        <li>Flexible Rules and Setup</li>
        <li>Detail and Historical Accuracy</li>
        <li>Wealth of Expansion Packs</li>
        <p>Things We Hated</p>
        <li>Long and Complicated Rule Book</li>
        <li>Setup takes too Long</li>
        <p>This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules and may be bored</p>
